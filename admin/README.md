# `admin/` Directory

This directory contains the HTML files specific to the administrative dashboard of the OSIS SMKN 7 Samarinda website.

## Purpose and Function

The `admin/` directory serves as the entry point and structural container for the backend management interface. It separates the administrative functionalities from the public-facing website, ensuring a clear distinction in content and access.

## Contents

-   `dashboard.html`: The main page for the admin dashboard, providing an overview and navigation to various management sections.
-   `login.html`: The authentication page for administrators to gain access to the dashboard.

These HTML files are linked to their respective CSS and JavaScript assets located within the `assets/` directory to render the complete administrative user interface.
