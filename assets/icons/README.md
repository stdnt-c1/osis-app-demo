# `assets/icons/` Directory

This directory is dedicated to storing icon assets, primarily those used for Progressive Web App (PWA) features, within the OSIS SMKN 7 Samarinda website.

## Purpose and Function

The `icons/` directory ensures that all necessary icons for the web application, especially those required by the `manifest.json` for PWA installation and display, are centrally located and easily accessible. This helps in maintaining a consistent visual identity across different platforms and devices.

## Contents

-   `icon-192x192.png`: A 192x192 pixel PNG icon, typically used for smaller application icons and splash screens.
-   `icon-512x512.png`: A 512x512 pixel PNG icon, used for larger application icons and high-resolution displays.

These icons are crucial for the PWA experience, allowing the website to be installed on a user's device and appear as a native application.
