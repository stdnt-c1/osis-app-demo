# `assets/js/` Directory

This directory contains all the JavaScript files that provide interactive functionality and dynamic content for the OSIS SMKN 7 Samarinda website.

## Purpose and Function

The `js/` directory is structured to separate JavaScript modules based on whether they serve the public-facing website or the administrative dashboard. This modularization enhances code organization, reusability, and maintainability.

## Contents

-   `public/`: Contains JavaScript modules specifically designed for the public-facing sections of the website. These modules handle features like sliders, gallery displays, news rendering, financial data visualization, suggestion form submissions, navigation, and general utility functions.
-   `admin/`: Contains JavaScript modules dedicated to the administrative dashboard. These modules manage authentication, navigation within the admin panel, data overview, CRUD operations for news, gallery, finance, suggestions, and users, form handling, modal interactions, and utility functions.

This clear separation ensures that the JavaScript codebase remains manageable and scalable as new features are added to either the public or administrative parts of the application.
