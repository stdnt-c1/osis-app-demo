# `assets/` Directory

This directory serves as the central repository for all static assets used across the OSIS SMKN 7 Samarinda website, encompassing both the public-facing and administrative sections.

## Purpose and Function

The `assets/` directory is designed to organize and host all non-HTML content that supports the visual presentation and interactive functionality of the website. This includes stylesheets, JavaScript files, images, and icons.

## Contents

-   `css/`: Contains all Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) files, further organized into subdirectories for public, admin, base, and component-specific styles.
-   `js/`: Contains all JavaScript files, modularized for both public and admin functionalities.
-   `img/`: Stores image assets used throughout the website.
-   `icons/`: Holds icon assets, particularly those used for Progressive Web App (PWA) features.

By centralizing these assets, the project maintains a clean structure and facilitates easier management and deployment of static content.
