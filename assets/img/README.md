# `assets/img/` Directory

This directory is designated for storing image assets used throughout the OSIS SMKN 7 Samarinda website.

## Purpose and Function

The `img/` directory serves as a centralized location for all visual media, such as photographs, illustrations, and other graphic elements that enhance the user interface and content presentation. While currently serving as a placeholder, it is intended to host actual project-specific images.

## Contents

-   Currently, this directory is a placeholder. In a full implementation, it would contain various image files (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`, `.svg`) used in different sections of the website, such as hero banners, gallery items, news article thumbnails, and general UI elements.
