# `assets/css/components/` Directory

This directory contains CSS styles for reusable UI components used throughout the OSIS SMKN 7 Samarinda website.

## Purpose and Function

The `components/` directory follows a component-based styling approach, where each file is dedicated to the styling of a specific, self-contained UI element. This promotes reusability, maintainability, and easier development by breaking down the UI into smaller, manageable parts.

## Contents

-   `_buttons.css`: Styles for various button types (e.g., primary, secondary, danger).
-   `_forms.css`: Styles for form elements, including form groups, labels, input fields, text areas, and select boxes.
-   `_modals.css`: Styles for general modal overlays and their content.
-   `_badges.css`: Styles for small, informative badges (e.g., status indicators).
-   `_filters.css`: Styles for filter buttons or filter group layouts.
-   `_tables.css`: Styles for data tables, including headers, rows, and cells.
-   `_utility.css`: Contains utility classes for common styling needs, such as text alignment, color variations, hidden/visible states, loading animations, and smooth transitions.

These component-specific stylesheets are imported into the main CSS entry points (`main.css` and `admin-main.css`) to be available for use across the application.
